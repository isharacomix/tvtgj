# The ASCII GFX module handles curses for us so that we don't have to do it
# ourselves. It's not object-oriented, so we should only ever have one game
# object trying to use it at a time. It uses a singleton screen object that
# represents the terminal window. If curses is unavailable, importing this
# module will fail, so you need to catch that when you import it.
