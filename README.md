It'll never catch on!
=====================

### A "two-stick" roguelike shooter set in the distant future.


Requirements
------------
To play this game, you need *Python* and Python's *curses* module. This comes
out of the box on Linux, and I don't know about Windows. If you want to play this
game on Windows, figure out the answer to the following questions:

 * How do I install Python on Windows
 * How do I install the unofficial Curses module on Windows?
 * How do I run "roguelike.py" on Windows?



Plot
----
You are a blue robot and are fighting evil bad red robots in a dark forest.
Bad robots are dumb, but dangerous. They will wander around aimlessly until
they find you, and when they do, they will sit there and shoot at you. If a
robot has you in its sights, you can see it's evil red eyes light up.

There are also power ups and stuff on the ground that can make you a stronger
robot which you should get.


Controls
--------
       e r               y u     
      s   f             h   k    
       x c               b n     
   'Left stick'     'Right stick'
    Aim Target        Move Robot

The target is represented on the screen in [ ] brackets. You can shoot from any
distance, but the farther away the target, the greater the chance of missing.
Use the 'Z' key to fire, and use 'D' to put away the target.

You can also give up with 'Q' but why would you do that.


Power Ups
---------
 * ```!```: Toughness. Makes your bullets do an additional damage. Enemies have
   five HP, so if you collect one, you kill enemies in 3 hits. If you collect two,
   you kill them in 2.
 * ```+```: Health. Gives you more HP. There is no maximum, so get all you can!
 * ```>```: Fast. Collect fast in order to take more actions in a turn.


Other Stuff
-----------
I recorded the development of this game on Youtube as a sort of video tutorial.
